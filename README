*ref* is a Vim plugin to view the reference.  This plugin can be separated to
core of viewer and sources of reference.  As a result, various references can
be viewed by the same interface.

Following sources are included in this plugin:
- alc (Online English-Japanese/Japanese-English dictionary)
- clojure
- erlang
- hoogle
- man
- perldoc
- phpmanual
- pydoc
- refe

Reference viewer is mere a buffer to view the reference.  This is opened by :Ref
command or K like :help.  If the reference viewer is already opened in current
tab page, it is used again.

This also includes unite-ref for unite.vim(vimscript #3396).
